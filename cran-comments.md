This is a new release. I see no errors, warnings, or notes. I have addressed the issues raised by Konstanze:

* Changed reference to shiny to appear as a package reference. Note that Posit tends to refer applications as Shiny in written documents.
* Added a doi to the description.
* Added \value to all functions.
* Removed example that was only a fragment of a shiny application. Instead referring users to the main server function.
* Changed all print() calls to message().

Thank you for your time.
