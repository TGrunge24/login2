```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)

library(login)
```

This is certainly not the first (and probably not the last) authentication scheme for Shiny applications. [ShinyManager](https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/) is a great solution if you want to protect the entire application (you pass your UI object so only authenticated users can view the application). The [`shinyauthr`](https://github.com/PaulC91/shinyauthr?tab=readme-ov-file) is another excellent package for providing simple user authentication. This package offers a number of features those packages do not, including:

* The ability for a users to create their own account.
* The ability for users to reset their password using an email system.
* UI elements to control what is visible when logged in or not logged in.
* Encrypting of the users' passwords client side (i.e. the Shiny server only sees the encrypted password using MD5).


## Installation

You can download the latest development version using the `remotes` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('jbryer/login')
```

## Getting Started

There is a template located at [`inst/login_template/app.R`](inst/login_template/app.R) that demonstrates the basic functionality. At minimum you need to call the `login_ui()` function in your UI. This will create a login box. This will also ensure the JavaScript and CSS assets are loaded to ensure the password is encrypted client size. It is important that you use the same `id` across all `login` functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
login::login_ui(id = 'login_demo')
```

To add a log out button use the `logout_ui()` function. Note that the button will only display if you are logged in.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
login::logout_ui('login_demo')
```

The `is_logged_in()` and `is_not_logged_in()` functions allow you encapsulate Shiny UI elements so they are only visible when the user is or is not logged in, respectively. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
login::is_logged_in(
  id = 'login_demo',
  div("This only shows when you are logged in!")
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
login::is_not_logged_in(
  id = 'login_demo',
  div("This only shows when you are NOT logged in!")
)
```

## My Wish List

List of features I hope to add soon (here for my own regulation):

* Abstract out data storage to allow for systems other than DBI.
* ~~Abstract out emailing (currently only used to reset passwords).~~
* ~~Have an option to require email verification for creating an account.~~
* ~~Allow for the collection of other metadata at time of user creation.~~
* Have the ability of assigning users to groups.
* Provide more options to adjust the appearance of UI.
* ~~Save user login using cookies.~~
* ~~Add created_date to new accounts.~~

## Disclaimer

I am not a security expert. I have made every effort to use the best practices to my knowledge. I highly recommend deploying your application using https (e.g. use nginx and letsencrypt) to ensure all communication between the client and server are encrypted. Any issues or concerns can be filed as a Github issue. Use at your own risk.
